# Distano - diatance estimation tool

The objective of this project is to develop an  web  application that utilizes the gyroscope sensor present on mobile  to calculate the distance between two points using the concept of triangulation. 
The application allows the user to mark two points on a map and, by using the gyroscope sensor data, calculates the distance between these points. The implementation involves obtaining the orientation of the device and then calculating the angles between the two points and the device. From this information, the distance between the points is calculated using the law of cosines. The application provides a simple and efficient way of calculating the distance between two points using the sensors available in most modern Android devices.
