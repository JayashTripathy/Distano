# Distano - diatance estimation tool

The objective of this project is to develop an  web  application that utilizes the gyroscope sensor present on mobile to calculate the distance between two points using the concept of triangulation. 

By using the gyroscope sensor data, calculates the distance between these points. The implementation involves obtaining the orientation of the device and then calculating the angles between the two points the reference point and the device. From this information, the distance between the points is calculated using the law of `triangulation`.

The application provides a simple and efficient way of calculating the distance between two points using the sensors available in most modern Android devices.
